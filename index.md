## A little bit more about me

I am a senior at UMass Amherst pursuing a B.S. degree in Computer Science. My expected date of graduation is May 2020 and I am going to be working at Facebook as a software engineer starting August 2020. Having a knack for problem solving and curiosity to learn new technologies, I spend a lot of time involving myself in open source projects and understanding other developers' frameworks.
